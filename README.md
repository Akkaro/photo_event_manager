# Photo Management Backend

Actual status: I got to make a front end login page which does actually build, and serve. The login can be made via frontend.

Upcomming TO DOs: Make a page listing albums, which can be opened to list photos. For this, the backend support is theoretically already done, frontend support is needed. Once this is done the actual display of the photos can be done. Then comes the editing part.


A Spring Boot application for managing photos in albums with user authentication, role-based access control, and basic photo editing capabilities.

## Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login and register using JWT with role-based access control (Admin, Moderator, User) (CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL)
- **Album Management**: Create, view, update, and delete photo albums (CURRENTLY PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL)
- **Photo Management**: Upload, organize, and manage photos within albums (CURRENTLY PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL)
- **Basic Photo Editing**: Apply simple edits like brightness and contrast adjustments (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
